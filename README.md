# Love-Me-or-Not---Interactive-Web-Page
This project features an interactive web page where users are asked the question "Do you love me?" with clickable buttons for 'Yes' and 'No'. The page is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The 'No' button adds a playful element by randomly repositioning itself on the screen upon hover.
